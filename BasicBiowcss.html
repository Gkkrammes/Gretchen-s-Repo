                 <p>I am currently a stay at home mom who is aiming to re-enter the workforce in the next year or so. My family lived in South Caroline for the last 3 years and just recently moved back to Indiana. I have 3 sons, 2 of which will be starting school over the next 2 years. I studied political science in college and have decided not to pursue further work in that area. I have also worked as a real estate agent and am currently a freelance makeup artist. I look forward to switching things up and pursuing a new career when this class is complete. My hobbies include singing, boating, and traveling. </p>
